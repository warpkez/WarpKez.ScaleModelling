## WarpKez.ScaleModelling

### A Collection of mathematical classes and models primarily used in scale modelling.

### Overview of classes

- Fractions
- Metric Conversion
- Scale Conversion
- Trigonometry

### Fractions Class

Methods and models for performing mathematical functions on fractions such as
- addition and subtration,
- multipication and division,
- finding the lowest common denominator,
- provide fraction sanititation,
- and simplify fractions.

### Metric Class

Methods and models for performing conversion between metric systems specifically imperial and metric measurements relating to distance
- Converting yard to feet, then to inches,
- Converting imperial to metric,
- Determinging the closest inch, above and below the given to 1/64th precision. (*I am flat out seeing 1/32"*) 

### Scale Class

Methods and models for performing conversions between scales and generating tables
- Converting from real world measurements to scale world imperial and metric,
- Generating conversion tables across common scales,
- Creating 'near enough' measurements for inches to with 1/64" precision.
- Create plot points for curves.

### Trigonometry Class

Methods and models related to triangles
- SIN, COS, TAN, 1/SIN, 1/COS, 1/TAN,
- How to find the length of each side from an angle and its companion side,
